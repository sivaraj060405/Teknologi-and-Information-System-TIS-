# Reflection
Industry Talk and Industry Visit
- The talk made me see that doing well in computer science means more than just knowing 
  programming languages like Python or C++ or using tools like GitHub and VSCode. It also needs 
  problem-solving, working in a team, and clear communication. These soft skills matter as much 
  as technical skills. In the next few years, I want to get better at technical skills by working on 
  projects that use what I study in class. I will focus on subjects like algorithms, cybersecurity, and 
  system optimization. I also plan to improve my teamwork and leadership skills through internships, 
  hackathons, or group projects. By being open to challenges and always learning, I think I can 
  become a capable and complete computer science professional, ready for any challenge I face.

Project (Design Thinking)
- This project makes a weather application using design thinking. It has 
  taught me about solving issues by looking at what users want. My skills 
  have gotten better in making solutions that work and look nice. Going 
  through brainstorming, making prototypes, and improving the 
  application has helped me blend creativity with technology, which is a 
  step towards my aim of being a good developer in this field.

Summary
- This course has equipped me with several valuable skills, including information filtering, hands-on expertise, effective group discussions, and fast learning of new concepts. The variety in assignments and 
  projects made the course very interactive and interesting since each activity presented a new challenge and avenue to be explored. The activities that were more enjoyable included the assembly of PCs, designing 
  posters, and brainstorming of ideas. Moreover, frequent group work promotes collaboration and offers opportunities to interact with international peers through in-class activities every week. However, I believe 
  there should be more balance between theory and practice. As much as the activity-based approach was indeed engaging, the inclusion of more theoretical lessons would have given the necessary sound basis for 
  understanding the concepts. A more balanced approach between theory and hands-on activities would further enrich the overall learning experience.
